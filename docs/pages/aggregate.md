# Aggregate

The linchpin of event-sourcing is the aggregate. These aggregates can be imagined like entities in ORM.
One main difference is that we don't save the current state, but only the individual events that led to the state.
This means it is always possible to build the current state again from the events.

!!! note

    The term aggregate itself comes from DDD and has nothing to do with event sourcing and can be used independently as a pattern. 
    You can find out more about Aggregates [here](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html).
    
An aggregate must fulfill a few points so that we can use it in event-sourcing:

* It must implement the `AggregateRoot` interface.
* It needs a unique identifier.
* It needs to provide the current playhead.
* It must make changes to his state available as events.
* And rebuild/catchup its state from the events.

We can implement this ourselves, or use the `BasicAggregateRoot` implementation that already brings everything with it.
This basic implementation uses attributes to configure the aggregate and to specify how it should handle events.
We are building a minimal aggregate class here which only has an ID and mark this with the `Id` attribute.
To make it easy to register with a name, we also add the `Aggregate` attribute. This is what it looks like:

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\Uuid;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Aggregate;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Id;

#[Aggregate('profile')]
final class Profile extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    #[Id]
    private Uuid $id;

    public static function register(Uuid $id): self
    {
        $self = new self();

        $self->id = $id; // we need to set the id temporary here for the basic example and will be replaced later.

        return $self;
    }
}
```
!!! warning

    The aggregate is not yet finished and has only been built to the point that you can instantiate the object.
    
!!! tip

    Find out more about aggregate IDs [here](./aggregate_id.md).
    
We use a so-called named constructor here to create an object of the AggregateRoot.
The constructor itself is protected and cannot be called from outside.
But it is possible to define different named constructors for different use-cases like `import`.

After the basic structure for an aggregate is in place, it could theoretically be saved:

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Repository\Repository;

final class CreateProfileHandler
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly Repository $profileRepository,
    ) {
    }

    public function __invoke(CreateProfile $command): void
    {
        $profile = Profile::register($command->id());

        $this->profileRepository->save($profile);
    }
}
```
!!! warning

    If you look in the database now, you would see that nothing has been saved.
    This is because only events are stored in the database and as long as no events exist,
    nothing happens.
    
!!! tip

    A **command bus** system is not necessary, only recommended.
    The interaction can also easily take place in a controller or service.
    
## Create a new aggregate

In order that an aggregate is actually saved, at least one event must exist in the DB.
For our aggregate we create the Event `ProfileRegistered` with an ID and a name.
We also give the event a unique name using the `Event` attribute.

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\Uuid;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Event;

#[Event('profile.registered')]
final class ProfileRegistered
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly Uuid $profileId,
        public readonly string $name,
    ) {
    }
}
```
!!! note

    You can find out more about events [here](./events.md).
    
After we have defined the event, we have to adapt the profile aggregate:

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\Uuid;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Aggregate;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Apply;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Id;

#[Aggregate('profile')]
final class Profile extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    #[Id]
    private Uuid $id;
    private string $name;

    public function name(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public static function register(Uuid $id, string $name): self
    {
        $self = new self();
        $self->recordThat(new ProfileRegistered($id, $name));

        return $self;
    }

    #[Apply]
    protected function applyProfileRegistered(ProfileRegistered $event): void
    {
        $this->id = $event->profileId;
        $this->name = $event->name;
    }
}
```
!!! tip

    Prefixing the apply methods with "apply" improves readability.
    
In our named constructor `register` we have now created the event and recorded it with the method `recordThat`.
The aggregate remembers all new recorded events in order to save them later.
At the same time, a defined `apply` method is executed directly so that we can change our state.

So that the AggregateRoot also knows which method it should call,
we have to mark it with the `Apply` attribute. We did that in the `applyProfileRegistered` method.
In there we then change the state of the aggregate by filling the properties with the values from the event.

!!! success

    The aggregate is now ready to be saved!
    
### Modify an aggregate

In order to change the state of the aggregates afterwards, only further events have to be defined.
As example we can add a `NameChanged` event:

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Event;

#[Event('profile.name_changed')]
final class NameChanged
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $name,
    ) {
    }
}
```
!!! note

    Events should best be written in the past, as they describe a state that has happened.
    
After we have defined the event, we can define a new public method called `changeName` to change the profile name.
This method then creates the event `NameChanged` and records it:

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\Uuid;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Aggregate;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Apply;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Id;

#[Aggregate('profile')]
final class Profile extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    #[Id]
    private Uuid $id;
    private string $name;

    public function name(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public static function register(Uuid $id, string $name): static
    {
        $self = new static();
        $self->recordThat(new ProfileRegistered($id, $name));

        return $self;
    }

    public function changeName(string $name): void
    {
        $this->recordThat(new NameChanged($name));
    }

    #[Apply]
    protected function applyProfileRegistered(ProfileRegistered $event): void
    {
        $this->id = $event->profileId;
        $this->name = $event->name;
    }

    #[Apply]
    protected function applyNameChanged(NameChanged $event): void
    {
        $this->name = $event->name;
    }
}
```
We have also defined a new `apply` method named `applyNameChanged`
where we change the name depending on the value in the event.

When using it, it can look like this:

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Repository\Repository;

final class ChangeNameHandler
{
    public function __construct(private Repository $profileRepository)
    {
    }

    public function __invoke(ChangeName $command): void
    {
        $profile = $this->profileRepository->load($command->id());
        $profile->changeName($command->name());

        $this->profileRepository->save($profile);
    }
}
```
!!! success

    Our aggregate can now be changed and saved.
    
!!! note

    You can read more about Repository [here](./repository.md).
    
Here the aggregate is loaded from the `repository` by fetching all events from the database.
These events are then executed again with the `apply` methods in order to rebuild the current state.
All of this happens automatically in the `load` method.

The method `changeName` is then executed on the aggregate to change the name.
In this method the event `NameChanged` is generated and recorded.
The `applyNameChanged` method was also called again internally to adjust the state.

When the `save` method is called on the repository,
all newly recorded events are then fetched and written to the database.
In this specific case only the `NameChanged` changed event.

## Multiple apply attributes on the same method

You can also define several apply attributes with different events using the same method.

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Aggregate;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Apply;

#[Aggregate('profile')]
final class Profile extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    // ...

    #[Apply(ProfileCreated::class)]
    #[Apply(NameChanged::class)]
    protected function applyProfileCreated(ProfileCreated|NameChanged $event): void
    {
        if ($event instanceof ProfileCreated) {
            $this->id = $event->profileId;
        }

        $this->name = $event->name;
    }
}
```
## Suppress missing apply methods

Sometimes you have events that do not change the state of the aggregate itself,
but are still recorded for the future or to subscribe for processor and projection.
So that you are not forced to write an apply method for it,
you can suppress the missing apply exceptions these events with the `SuppressMissingApply` attribute.

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Aggregate;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Apply;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\SuppressMissingApply;

#[Aggregate('profile')]
#[SuppressMissingApply([NameChanged::class])]
final class Profile extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    // ...

    #[Apply]
    protected function applyProfileCreated(ProfileCreated $event): void
    {
        $this->id = $event->profileId;
        $this->name = $event->name;
    }
}
```
## Suppress missing apply for all methods

You can also completely deactivate the exceptions for missing apply methods.

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Aggregate;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Apply;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\SuppressMissingApply;

#[Aggregate('profile')]
#[SuppressMissingApply(SuppressMissingApply::ALL)]
final class Profile extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    // ...

    #[Apply]
    protected function applyProfileCreated(ProfileCreated $event): void
    {
        $this->id = $event->profileId;
        $this->name = $event->name;
    }
}
```
!!! warning

    When all events are suppressed, debugging becomes more difficult if you forget an apply method.
    
## Child Aggregates

??? example "Experimental"

    This feature is still experimental and may change in the future.
    Use it with caution.

In some cases, it makes sense to split an aggregate into several smaller aggregates.
This can be the case if the aggregate becomes too large or if the aggregate is used in different contexts.
Child aggregates can be used for this purpose and work in the same way as the root aggregate.

In the following example, we have an `Order` aggregate that has a `Shipping` child aggregate.

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicChildAggregate;

final class Shipping extends BasicChildAggregate
{
    private bool $arrived = false;

    public function __construct(
        private string $trackingId,
    ) {
    }

    public function arrive(): void
    {
        $this->recordThat(new Arrived());
    }

    #[Apply]
    public function applyArrived(Arrived $event): void
    {
        $this->arrived = true;
    }

    public function isArrived(): bool
    {
        return $this->arrived;
    }
}
```
!!! warning

    The apply method must be public, otherwise the root aggregate cannot call it.
    
!!! note

    Supress missing apply methods need to be defined in the root aggregate.
    
And the `Order` aggregate root looks like this:

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\Uuid;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\ChildAggregate;

#[Aggregate('order')]
final class Order extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    #[ChildAggregate]
    private Shipping $shipping;

    public static function create(Uuid $id, string $trackingId): static
    {
        $self = new static();
        $self->recordThat(new OrderCreated($id, $trackingId));

        return $self;
    }

    public function applyOrderCreated(OrderCreated $event): void
    {
        $this->shipping = new Shipping($event->trackingId);
    }

    public function arrive(): void
    {
        $this->shipping->arrive();
    }
}
```
## Business rules

Usually, aggregates have business rules that must be observed. Like there may not be more than 10 people in a group.

These rules must be checked before an event is recorded.
As soon as an event was recorded, the described thing happened and cannot be undone.

A further check in the apply method is also not possible because these events have already happened
and were then also saved in the database.

In the next example we want to make sure that **the name is at least 3 characters long**:

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Aggregate;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Apply;

#[Aggregate('profile')]
final class Profile extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    // ...

    public function changeName(string $name): void
    {
        if (strlen($name) < 3) {
            throw new NameIsToShortException($name);
        }

        $this->recordThat(new NameChanged($name));
    }

    #[Apply]
    protected function applyNameChanged(NameChanged $event): void
    {
        $this->name = $event->name;
    }
}
```
!!! danger

    Validations during "apply" should not happen, they will break the rebuilding of the aggregate!
    Instead validate the data *before* the event will be recorded.
    
We have now ensured that this rule takes effect when a name is changed with the method `changeName`.
But when we create a new profile this rule does not currently apply.

In order for this to work, we either have to duplicate the rule or outsource it.
Here we show how we can do it all with a value object:

```php
final class Name
{
    public function __construct(private string $value)
    {
        if (strlen($value) < 3) {
            throw new NameIsToShortException($value);
        }
    }

    public function toString(): string
    {
        return $this->value;
    }
}
```
We can now use the value object `Name` in our aggregate:

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\Uuid;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Aggregate;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Apply;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Id;

#[Aggregate('profile')]
final class Profile extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    #[Id]
    private Uuid $id;
    private Name $name;

    public static function register(Uuid $id, Name $name): static
    {
        $self = new static();
        $self->recordThat(new ProfileRegistered($id, $name));

        return $self;
    }

    // ...

    public function name(): Name
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function changeName(Name $name): void
    {
        $this->recordThat(new NameChanged($name));
    }

    #[Apply]
    protected function applyNameChanged(NameChanged $event): void
    {
        $this->name = $event->name;
    }
}
```
In order for the whole thing to work, we still have to adapt our `NameChanged` event,
since we only expected a string before but now passed a `Name` value object.

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Event;

#[Event('profile.name_changed')]
final class NameChanged
{
    public function __construct(
        #[NameNormalizer]
        public readonly Name $name,
    ) {
    }
}
```
!!! warning

    You need to create a normalizer for the `Name` value object.
    So the payload must be serializable and unserializable as json.
    
!!! note

    You can find out more about normalizer [here](./normalizer.md).
    
There are also cases where business rules have to be defined depending on the aggregate state.
Sometimes also from states, which were changed in the same method.
This is not a problem, as the `apply` methods are always executed immediately.

In the next case we throw an exception if the hotel is already overbooked.
Besides that, we record another event `FullyBooked`, if the hotel is fully booked with the last booking.
With this event we could [notify](./subscription.md) external systems
or fill a [projection](./subscription.md) with fully booked hotels.

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Aggregate;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Apply;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\SuppressMissingApply;

#[Aggregate('hotel')]
#[SuppressMissingApply([FullyBooked::class])]
final class Hotel extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    private const SIZE = 5;

    private int $people;

    // ...

    public function book(string $name): void
    {
        if ($this->people === self::SIZE) {
            throw new NoPlaceException($name);
        }

        $this->recordThat(new RoomBocked($name));

        if ($this->people !== self::SIZE) {
            return;
        }

        $this->recordThat(new FullyBooked());
    }

    #[Apply]
    protected function applyRoomBocked(RoomBocked $event): void
    {
        $this->people++;
    }
}
```
## Working with dates

An aggregate should always be deterministic. In other words, whenever I execute methods on the aggregate,
I always get the same result. This also makes testing much easier.

But that often doesn't seem to be possible, e.g. if you want to save a createAt date.
But you can pass this information by yourself.

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\Uuid;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Aggregate;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Id;

#[Aggregate('profile')]
final class Profile extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    #[Id]
    private Uuid $id;
    private Name $name;
    private DateTimeImmutable $registeredAt;

    public static function register(Uuid $id, string $name, DateTimeImmutable $registeredAt): static
    {
        $self = new static();
        $self->recordThat(new ProfileRegistered($id, $name, $registeredAt));

        return $self;
    }

    // ...
}
```
But if you still want to make sure that the time is "now" and not in the past or future, you can pass a clock.

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\BasicAggregateRoot;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Aggregate\Uuid;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Aggregate;
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Attribute\Id;
use Psr\Clock\ClockInterface;

#[Aggregate('profile')]
final class Profile extends BasicAggregateRoot
{
    #[Id]
    private Uuid $id;
    private Name $name;
    private DateTimeImmutable $registeredAt;

    public static function register(Uuid $id, string $name, ClockInterface $clock): static
    {
        $self = new static();
        $self->recordThat(new ProfileRegistered($id, $name, $clock->now()));

        return $self;
    }

    // ...
}
```
Now you can pass the `SystemClock` to determine the current time.
Or for test purposes the `FrozenClock`, which always returns the same time.

!!! note

    You can find out more about clock [here](./clock.md).
    
## Aggregate Root Registry

The library needs to know about all aggregates so that the correct aggregate class is used to load from the database.
There is an `AggregateRootRegistry` for this purpose. The registry is a simple hashmap between aggregate name and aggregate class.

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Metadata\AggregateRoot\AggregateRootRegistry;

$aggregateRegistry = new AggregateRootRegistry([
    'profile' => Profile::class,
]);
```
So that you don't have to create it by hand, you can use a factory.
By default, the `AttributeAggregateRootRegistryFactory` is used.
There, with the help of paths, all classes with the attribute `Aggregate` are searched for
and the `AggregateRootRegistry` is built up.

```php
use Patchlevel\EventSourcing\Metadata\Event\AttributeEventRegistryFactory;

$aggregateRegistry = (new AttributeEventRegistryFactory())->create([/* paths... */]);
```
