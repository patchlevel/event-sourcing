# Event-Sourcing

- [Pipeline](pipeline.md) to build new [projections](projection.md) or to migrate events
- [Projectionist](projectionist.md) for managed, versioned and asynchronous projections
- [Scheme management](store.md) and [doctrine migration](migration.md) support
- Dev [tools](watch_server.md) such as a realtime event watcher
