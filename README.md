# Event-Sourcing

A lightweight but also all-inclusive event sourcing library with a focus on developer experience.

## Features

* Everything is included in the package for event sourcing
* Based on [doctrine dbal](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal) and their ecosystem
* Developer experience oriented and fully typed
* [Snapshots](https://patchlevel.github.io/event-sourcing-docs/latest/snapshots/) and [Split-Stream](https://patchlevel.github.io/event-sourcing-docs/latest/split_stream/) system to quickly rebuild the aggregates
* [Pipeline](https://patchlevel.github.io/event-sourcing-docs/latest/pipeline/) to build new [projections](https://patchlevel.github.io/event-sourcing-docs/latest/projection/) or to migrate events
* [Projectionist](https://patchlevel.github.io/event-sourcing-docs/latest/projection/#projectionist) for managed, versioned and asynchronous projections
* [Scheme management](https://patchlevel.github.io/event-sourcing-docs/latest/store/) and [doctrine migration](https://patchlevel.github.io/event-sourcing-docs/latest/migration/) support
* Dev [tools](https://patchlevel.github.io/event-sourcing-docs/latest/watch_server/) such as a realtime event watcher
* Built in [cli commands](https://patchlevel.github.io/event-sourcing-docs/latest/cli/) with [symfony](https://symfony.com/)

## Supported databases

We officially only support the databases and versions listed in the table, as these are tested in the CI.
Since the package is based on doctrine dbal, other databases such as OracleDB and MSSQL may also work.
But we can only really support the databases if we can also automatically ensure that they don't break due to changes.

| Database    | Version                         |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| PostgresSQL | 11.19, 12.14, 13.10, 14.7, 15.2 |
| MariaDB     | 10.3, 10.6, 10.10               |
| MySQL       | 5.7, 8.0                        |
| SQLite      | 3.x                             |
